# Snake Game

### Status: WIP
Currently working on optimization for Reinforcement learning approach.

P.S. Currently there is an optimization implemented in branch rl-optimization which vastly improves learning time but presents a bug in rare occasions, which I'm working on currently.

## Description
A simple snake game with implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithm and A* Path Finding algorithm for autonomous playthrough

### Requirements
- Numpy
- Pygame

### Installation
1: Clone the project

2: Install dependencies; pip install -r requirements.txt

3: Run the script, there are three ways you can play the game:

- For Reinforcement Learning: python . 200 200 rl
- For A* algorithm: python . 200 200 a*
- For Manual playthrough: python . 200 200

*Note: the numbers in the script could be different, the numbers represent height and width, they should be a pair, ex. 100x100, 200x200, 300x300 and so on.
